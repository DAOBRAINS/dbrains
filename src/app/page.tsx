              DBrains (for Decentralized Brains or DAO Brains) is a fully
              collaborative freelancing platform governed, self developed and
              self-founded by a DAO. The platform itself and the projects
              launched from the platform are developed by self organized
              collaborators forming DAOs. Central to the system is the
              monitoring of contribution to achieve fairness in remuneration. A
              specific tokenomics based on NTT (non transferable tokens) allow
              the control of investments into the platform and a fair
              remuneration for the builders. This project aims at harnessing the
              power of collective intelligence by allowing anybody to contribute
              and/or learn from his peers. This project aims at improving the
              efficiency of the labor market lowering the barrier of
              participation and developing tools to improve the efficiency of
              collaborative work, ultimately scaling the federation of
              collective intelligence and community governance to large
              communities.
