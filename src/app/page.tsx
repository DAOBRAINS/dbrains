          DBrains (for Decentralized Brains or DAO Brains) is a fully
          collaborative freelancing platform governed, self developed and
          self-founded by a DAO. The platform itself and the projects launched
          from the platform are developed by self organized collaborators
          forming DAOs. Central to the system is the monitoring of contribution
          to achieve fairness in remuneration. A specific tokenomics based on
          NTT (non transferable tokens) allow the control of investments into
          the platform and a fair remuneration for the builders. This project
          aims at harnessing the power of collective intelligence by allowing
          anybody to contribute and/or learn from his peers. This project aims
          at improving the efficiency of the labor market lowering the barrier
          of participation and developing tools to improve the efficiency of
          collaborative work, ultimately scaling the federation of collective
          intelligence and community governance to large communities.

          Members can propose new projects which are listed in the projects
          board. There can be many sort of projects, like "paid projects" for
          which the projects launchers lock payments in escrow which can be
          distributed to contributors at the fulfillment of the project. There
          can also be "free projects" whose members gather together around the
          development of some ideas. Some projects are open to everyone, some
          projects may wish to select who is onboarded. The members of the
          projects self-organize to propose developments paths. Decisions are
          taken democratically. Members determine together how to split the
          development into tasks and assign them, and basically design together
          the entire project. The rewards for the fulfillment of tasks are also
          determined and validated by the DAOs. The monitoring/evaluation of
          members contributions will be initially mainly performed by DAOs, but
          could be later combined with the monitoring/evaluation by some AI
          algorithms. So that people can be guaranteed to be fairly remunerated
          for their ideas and hard working. Tools like feature.sh for the setup
          of bounties, or Sourcecred.io for the monitoring of contribution could
          be integrated into the platform for this purpose.

        <p className="text-2xl p-5">Platform Tokenomics:</p>{" "}
        <p className="text-lg p-5">
          The DBR token associated with the main DAO's platform is a Non
          Transferable Token (NTT). Members who do contribute to the platform
          development receive DBR NTT tokens if their contribution is validated
          by the DAO. DBR tokens are somewhat equivalent to equity in
          traditional companies, they are bound to the contributors who earned
          them. They cannot be transferred. When the project is coming to
          maturity and generate money, contributors will receive dividends
          depending on their earned NTTs. The DAO can decide to open to
          investors, who can purchase DBRs in exchange of currencies at a rate
          determined by the DAO. The currencies are deposited into the DAO
          treasury which can decide to use it for different purposes. Investors
          are then part of the DAO like others contributors owners of DBRs. DAO
          members can use the treasury for hiring external services or for
          providing remuneration to the members, who can decide to burn some of
          their DBRs in exchange of some payment in available currencies. This
          system will avoid speculation typical to web3 project and reward
          contributors fairly. Thus the platform will self developed without the
          need for initial investment. Projects developed through the platform
          can be similarly associated with NTT tokens and funding/remuneration
          managed along the same lines. But Projects launchers are free to
          decide the type of tokenomics they want for their project. Projects
          launchers will pay some fee to the DBrains DAO for using the Platform.
