# DBrains Project (2023 DAO Global Hackathon)

DBrains (for Decentalized Brains or DAO Brains) is a fully collaborative freelancing platform governed, self developed and self-founded by a DAO. The platform itself and the projects launched from the platform are developed by self organized collaborators forming DAOs. Central to the system is the monitoring of contribution to achieve fairness in remuneration. A specific tokenomics based on NTT (non transferable tokens) allow the control of investments into the platform and a fair remuneration for the builders. This project aims at harnessing the power of collective intelligence by allowing anybody to contribute and/or learn from his peers. This project aims at improving the efficiency of the labor market lowering the barrier of participation and developing tools to improve the efficiency of collaborative work, ultimately scaling the federation of collective intelligence and community governance to large communities.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
